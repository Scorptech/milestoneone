You can check out my milestone at -   https://github.com/Scorptech/MilestoneOne


The idea for this mock up website came about when speaking a builder that has been doing work for my family over the last few years.  The builders name is “Willie” and he is highly recommended by everyone as his workmanship and project management skills have always been spot on, hence why he is always in demand.

After having Willie complete some work for a family member I found out that this is something that he would like to do but just does not have the time to allocate to it. So for my first milestone project, I wanted to design a mock up site for Willie so the next time I see him, I can show him.

His business is unique as he offers a “turnkey” solution. So instead of customers hiring a builder, plumber, electrician etc, Willie can come in and project managed the development as he has his own team of people covering all the areas required for construction. This takes a huge amount of stress off the customer. 

Normally companies would have a photo gallery of previous work but we all know that some of these companies download library images for their website, hence why there is no photo gallery of previous work on the website. Willie prefers customers to visit customers and see the work for themselves. In most cases, this is how he gets new business, people seeing his work and then they contact him. 

So the website is purely for customers who just want to get a ball park figure regarding costs. Then they can decide if they want to move forward after Willie has given them the quote. In most cases, this is what people want to know i.e. this is what I want, how much will it cost me?

The business goals of this website are:

-   To give people the option to request a quote without phoning Willie and taking up his time
-   The give customers an uncluttered, easy to use and graphically pleasing website experience
-   To allow customer to request for quotes 24/7 and to also request information regarding         previous work

The customer goals of this website are:

-   Searching for a building company that can offer a “turnkey” solution for their project.
-   Clear easy navigation.
-   Information that they are members of the builders & tradesman Guild for peace of mind

## UX

#### Ideal client

##### The ideal client for this business is:

-   English speaking.
-   Has funding for the project they require
-   Are happy to leave Willie and his team to get on with the work without micro-managing 
-   Understands that building regulations can affect the cost of a project  

##### Visitors to this website are searching for:

-   A company that can offer a turnkey solution and manage their project from start to finish
-   Being patient regarding their quote request as building regulation information might need      to be researched before an estimated quote is provided

##### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

-   Most builders do not have a website.
-   Most of the builders websites on the internet that are active, do not offer a turnkey          solution
-   You will be given the option to visit work completed with previous customers.

-   This website is:

-   Easy to navigate.
-   Easy to understand and navigate the information.
-   Gives the client the ability to request a quote 24/7.
-   Guiding them to the goal of the website – request a quote or fill out the contact form.

##### Client stories

1.  As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site and feel comfortable with the builder and his commitment 
2.  As a new visitor to the website, I want the ability to request a quote for some construction  work I require. A ball park figure is all I need now,         which will determine whether I go ahead with the construction. 
3.  As a potential client, I want the option to view the builders previous work and speak to existing customers regarding the service they received.
6.  As an interested client, I want to understand what might be involved in a project before I make an decisions. The ability to request a quote means that     I will receive information that will be me an initial idea as to whether I can proceed with the project.
7.  As an interested client, I want an easy to fill in contact form, so I can make contact with the builder should I need general building information.
8.  As an interested observer and/or potential client, I want to follow the builder on social media to keep up with his latest news.
9.  As a returning visitor to the website, who has already decided to contact the builder using the contact form, I want to be able to find the request a quote based on my initial enquiry.
